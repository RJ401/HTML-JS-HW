        <p><strong>Born in Providence, Rhode Island, an overflowing trove of useless knowledge that is mostly irrelevant to anyone not currently involved in a heated game of Jeopardy, is passionate about computer science, math, and different variations of mac and cheese dishes. He brings a wealth of knowledge and a proven track record of chaos to just about anything he is involved with. Ray is currently focused on obtaining his bachelors degree in software engineering and is eager to be able to leverage his skills and expertise to back end development and tasting all the mac and cheese the world has to offer.</strong></p>
